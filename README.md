# Real-Estate-Valuation-Analysis

Analyzed a real estate valuation dataset specifically from Taiwan by using predictive modeling to correctly predict the Price per Unit Area of the houses 
by considering the influence of various factors such as the transaction date, house age, distance to MRT stations, proximity of convenience stores, and 
geographical location. In the study, we compared the performance and interpretation of the results of different machine learning models and identified the 
most influential factors for the case.

Per Unit Area of the houses was best predicted using Random Forest model with best RMSE= 6.9.
